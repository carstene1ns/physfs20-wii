PhysFS 2.0.3 for Nintendo Wii

Installation
------------

Be sure DevkitPPC and libogc is installed and $DEVKITPRO is an exported variable.

Then the usual

cd /to/physfs20-wii/dir
make -j <number of processor cores/threads> (eg. -j2)

will build the library. I have not yet completed the Makefile, so you have to
manually copy library and header file to your DevkitPro installation folder.

Use
---

Include PhysFS headers in your source files, eg:
#include "physfs.h"

Add -lphysfs to your LIBS in Makefile

If you need file system access, use an external library (for example libfat)
and initalize it before trying to access any files.

TODO / BUGS / Limitations
-------------------------

* Add proper Wii thread support
* Base directory is root directory of device (sd:/, usb:/),
  when program is loaded from external (usbgecko/net)
* User directory is fixed to root directory as well
* Possibly crashes if no file system access library
  is loaded and trying to access anything
